# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

This is a simple Python project that allows users to check the strength of their passwords and receive suggestions for stronger alternatives. It ensures passwords meet essential security requirements and categorizes them as **Weak**, **Fair**, or **Strong** based on their length.

## 🧠 How It Works

The program checks whether a password meets the following minimum requirements:

- ✅ At least **2 uppercase** letters
- ✅ At least **2 lowercase** letters
- ✅ At least **2 digits**
- ✅ At least **1 special character** (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)
- ✅ Minimum **length of 8 characters**

Then, based on the **length**, it categorizes the strength as:
- **Weak**: Exactly 8 characters (minimum acceptable)
- **Fair**: 9 to 12 characters
- **Strong**: 13 or more characters

If the password doesn't meet the requirements, the program tells you what’s missing and suggests a stronger password that satisfies all the rules.
